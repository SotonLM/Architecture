# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates apply to the `main` branch. Older releases are maintained on a best-effort basis only when explicitly tagged as Long-Term Support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately so we can triage and fix them before public disclosure. To report an issue:

1. Email `ase1g23@soton.ac.uk` with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
2. Include reproduction steps, impact analysis, and any proof-of-concept material.
3. Allow at least 72 hours for an initial response. We will coordinate on remediation steps and disclosure timelines.

If you cannot reach us via email, open a security advisory in GitHub's "Security" tab for this repository and provide the necessary details.

## Preferred Disclosure Process

- We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days.
- We will provide regular status updates until the fix is ready.
- Once a fix is available, we will coordinate with you on a public disclosure date.

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
